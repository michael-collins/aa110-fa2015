##2D Animation: Ball Bounce

In this exercise, you will produce an animated ball bouncing, a fundamental first lesson for anyone who studies animation. A bouncing ball is harder to animate than one might think, and requires the use of a few of the 12 main [principles of animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation). Some principles in use in the animation example below include easing (slow in, slow out), squash and stretch, anticipation, arc, and timing.

##Steps to Completion

1. Watch relevant tutorials

2. Create a project folder called **_ballbounce_yourstudentID_**

3. Use Adobe After Effects to create an animation 1 to 3 seconds in length.

    1. Composition settings Preset: **HDTV 1080 24**

    2. Animate a bouncing ball. It must bounce at least 3 times.

        1. Apply keyframes to position the ball bounces

        2. Modify the trajectory of the balls movement

        3. Use the graph editor to match the velocity of the ball bounce to its trajectory

        4. Use the scale tool to squash and stretch the ball show emphasize movement and speed. Be careful to maintain volume.

        5. Keyframe rotation of the ball to match the direction of the stretch of the ball

    3. Export the 1-3 second animation in H.264 format and save as

        6. [After Effects Export tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dj-aZ1UAmXEwH1yGbqMDFeXfcpKRTD2KvamBhpVNhEo/edit?usp=sharing)

    4. Save your After Effects file as **_ballbounce_yourstudentID.aep_**

    5. Post the H.264 video on Vimeo.com (create an account if you don’t have one)

4. Post the link for the video on the Lore.com discussion page

5. Compress(zip) the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_ballbounce_yourstudentID.zip_**

6. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded all relevant assets will result in your exercise being graded as an incomplete or late submission. Please review that you have included all desired files listed in the Steps to Completion.

7. Upload the .zip file to the [Ball Bounce Dropbox](https://psu.box.com/signup/collablink/d_4284116663/113056d8c8fe2d)
