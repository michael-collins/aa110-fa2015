4. Create a low-poly vector logo or illustration in Adobe Illustrator representing the article’s main issue, see examples.

`Note: You can NOT use the image included with the article to “trace,” as that could land you in court. I recommend using an image that is Creative Commons licensed for derivative use, or using images that are GPL licensed.`

5. Bring the illustration into Adobe Photoshop. The document size should be 8.5in by 11in with 300ppi resolution.
6. Add one word to the canvas that sums up the article’s theme.
7. Perform additional adjustments the poster including color grading, modifying the typography, adding texture, and adding other design elements.
