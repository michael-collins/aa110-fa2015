##2D Animation: Rotoscoping

In this exercise, you will create an animation up to 20 seconds based on the work of Eadweard Muybridge, a pioneer of film technology. You will practice an animation technique called rotoscoping, where the original footage is traced to capture movement and other attributes. In this exercise, it is only necessary to capture the gesture of the original footage with your animation, you do not need to capture the complex forms present in the original footage. You can combine other animation and post-production techniques to give your work as much visual complexity as you like.

##Steps to Completion

1. Watch relevant tutorials

2. Create a project folder called **rotoscope_yourstudentID**

3. Use Adobe AfterEffects to create an animation up to 20 seconds in length.

4. Find a pre-existing video of an Eadweard Muybridge plate or create an image sequence from a still image by separating and aligning the frames in Photoshop, each on their own layers.

    1. Creating an image sequence from Photoshop:

        1. Open a plate image

        2. Cut each frame from the image and move it to its own layer

        3. Name each layer containing one frame from the plate according to the frame number. There must be no spaces in the name

        4. Align the frames. The first frame should be the highest in the layer order and should descend to the last frame

        5. Crop the canvas to the size of the frame

        6. **File** → **Export** → **Layers to Files...** 

        7. Choose a sub-folder in your project folder

        8. You should now see all the frames as individual images

5. Create a new composition in AfterEffects

    2. **Preset:** HD1080 24

6. Import the image sequence

    3. Drag the image sequence folder into the AfterEffects Project panel

        9. If the sequence isn’t working, your file names are not correct, use Adobe Bridge’s batch renaming function to rename the files to a format that AfterEffects can read. 

    4. Right click on the image sequence footage, and choose **Interpret Footage** → **Main**.

        10. Change the assumed framerate to **24** frames per second.

        11. Click ok

7. Move the sequence to the timeline and begin to animate using the footage as a guide

8. When finished animating, export your composition using the **Animation** preset: [Exporting in AfterEffects and Media Encoder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dj-aZ1UAmXEwH1yGbqMDFeXfcpKRTD2KvamBhpVNhEo/edit?usp=sharing)

9. You can perform additional edits to your animation

10. Add sound effects, but do not add music

11. Add credits and ensure the credits properly cite any sound or image used in your animation

12. Export the final video as H.264 and upload to vimeo.com

13. Post a link to vimeo on the Lore.com discussion page

14. Rename your final animation as **_rotoscope_yourstudentID.mp4_** and upload the file to the [Rotoscope Dropbox](https://psu.box.com/signup/collablink/d_4284117231/1189d0668b910d)
