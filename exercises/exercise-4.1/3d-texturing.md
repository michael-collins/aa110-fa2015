##3D Texturing
	

In this exercise, you will gain familiarity with texturing in industry standard 3D software, Autodesk Maya. You will only be responsible for texturing a polygon model in this exercise. The design brief will continue for following 3D exercises on texturing, and animation.

###Design Brief:

Design an **Animated Architectural Fantasy** for this [mad libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) style theme: **"How might we ________ ?"**

You can choose to tackle a theme prevalent in popular media related to topics ranging from the environment to food, war/conflict, economics, transportation, domestic life, education, etc. Alternatively, you can invent a fictional scenario that is nostalgic, futurist, other-dimensional, absurdist, etc.

###Constraints:

1. You must create a polygonal model, textures, and animations yourself.

2. You must create an architectural space. There can be other objects, characters, or props in your model.

3. There must be at least one animated element.

4. Animations must seamlessly loop

5. Your work must be suitable to be uploaded to Sketchfab.com

###Production:

1. Draw concept sketches ([sketch sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzXX6rmROMNWYThXbkNIRl9XblU/view?usp=sharing)) to plan and pre-visualize your work.

2. When creating a polygonal model, consider using as few polygons as possible to construct your polygonal meshes.

3. Obsess over perfect edge flow, create water-tight geometry, and avoid n-gons as much as possible.

4. When texturing, think about materials, colors, structural and fastening elements, seams, ornamentation, objects, and other artifacts related to your investigation of the theme.

5. Consider the value that animation brings to your 3D model. Will you use animated elements to show transformations in materiality, change states of form and function, educate viewers, establish environmental context, or construct a particular aesthetic?

##Steps to Completion

1. Watch the Autodesk Maya tutorials, or see releant chapters in one of the textbooks.

2. Create a Maya project folder (**File** → **Project Folder**).

    1. Save Maya project folder as  **_3d_texture_yourstudentID_**

    2. Save Maya scene as **_3d_texture_yourstudentID.mb_**

3. Create 2D textures and apply them to your polygonal model.

4. [Unwrap](http://www.lynda.com/Maya-tutorials/Using-UV-Texture-Editor/162450/179979-4.html) your model’s UVs and save the UV snapshot as **_ex_5.2_uv_01_yourstudentID.jpg_**

    3. Place this file into the "sourceimages" folder

5. Create a JPG texture to apply to your polygonal model

    4. Save JPG texture as **_3d_texture_01_yourstudentID.jpg_**

    5. Save additional JPG textures with with the following naming convention: **_3d_texture_##_yourstudentID.jpg_**

    6. Place files into "sourceimages" folder

6. Upload the .zip file to the [3D Texuring Dropbox](https://psu.box.com/signup/collablink/d_4798422541/113ade6c535aa6)
