##Digital Fabrication Exhibition

**Project Details**  
In this project, you will work in small teams with a variety of software and technical processes to create a digitally designed and fabricated object or set in a live environment. You must activate the surfaces of the fabrcation through 2D or 3D animation. This project will culminate in a collective exhibition of work.

**Exhibition theme: Speculative Virtual Places**  
Any community has three kinds of places, A first, second, and third place. A _first_ place refers to the home, a _second_ place refers to work, and a _third_ place refers to neutral, welcoming environments like cafés, parks, or other low cost or approachable locations. As technology evolves, _third_ places are now manifesting virtually as games, 3D community spaces, chat rooms, etc. Can we concieve of some other kind of virtual place?

In making work for this exhibition, consider what would this place look like, what you would want do there, what it's purpose would be, how it was manifested, and how would you engage with it? Would there be analogues to physical archetecture, would there be passive/active interaction, or communication? Your work can be a working example of this place, be a speculative artifact that one might find in such a place, or provide a description and provoke discussion about the theme. You do not need to interpret the theme in a literal sense, but may describe overarching concepts or identify subthemes.

**Work format type options**

1. Live digital projection onto objects (Projection Mapping)
2. Video compiliation of textures or projections applied to fabricated surfaces (Stop motion 2D animation)
3. Video compiliation of multiple animated objects (Stop motion 2D animation)
4. Any combination of the above types

**You will produce the following during this project:**

  1. A 3D model in your favorite modeling software
  2. A fabricated replica of your 3D model with 3D printing, CNC routing, laser cutting, or other CAD based production processes
  3. Animation that will be mapped to your model
  4. Sound that corresponds with the animation
  5. A class-wide installation for the projection mapping exhibition
